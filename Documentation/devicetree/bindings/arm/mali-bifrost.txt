* ARM Mali Midgard devices


Required properties:

- compatible : Should be mali<chip>, replacing digits with x from the back,
until malit<Major>xx, ending with arm,mali-midgard, the latter not optional.
- reg : Physical base address of the device and length of the register area.
- interrupts : Contains the three IRQ lines required by T-6xx devices
- interrupt-names : Contains the names of IRQ resources in the order they were
provided in the interrupts property. Must contain: "JOB, "MMU", "GPU".

Optional:

- clocks : Phandle to clock for the Mali T-6xx device.
- clock-names : Shall be "clk_mali".
- mali-supply : Phandle to regulator for the Mali device. Refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt for details.
- operating-points-v2 : Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/opp.txt
for details.
- jm_config : For T860/T880. Sets job manager configuration. An array containing:
	- 1 to override the TIMESTAMP value, 0 otherwise.
	- 1 to override clock gate, forcing them to be always on, 0 otherwise.
	- 1 to enable job throttle, limiting the number of cores that can be started
	  simultaneously, 0 otherwise.
	- Value between 0 and 63 (including). If job throttle is enabled, this is one
	  less than the number of cores that can be started simultaneously.
- power_model : Sets the power model parameters. Three power models are currently
  defined which include "mali-simple-power-model", "mali-g71-power-model" and
	  "mali-g72-power-model".
	- mali-simple-power-model: this model derives the GPU power usage based
	  on the GPU voltage scaled by the system temperature. Note: it was
	  designed for the Juno platform, and may not be suitable for others.
		- compatible: Should be "arm,mali-simple-power-model"
		- dynamic-coefficient: Coefficient, in pW/(Hz V^2), which is
		  multiplied by v^2*f to calculate the dynamic power consumption.
		- static-coefficient: Coefficient, in uW/V^3, which is
		  multiplied by v^3 to calculate the static power consumption.
		- ts: An array containing coefficients for the temperature
		  scaling factor. This is used to scale the static power by a
		  factor of tsf/1000000,
		  where tsf = ts[3]*T^3 + ts[2]*T^2 + ts[1]*T + ts[0],
		  and T = temperature in degrees.
		- thermal-zone: A string identifying the thermal zone used for
		  the GPU
		- temp-poll-interval-ms: the interval at which the system
		  temperature is polled
	- mali-g71-power-model / mali-g72-power-model: these models derive
	  the GPU power usage based on performance counters, so they are more
	  accurate.
		- compatible: Should be "arm,mali-g71-power-model" /
		  "arm,mali-g72-power-model"
		- scale: the dynamic power calculated by the power model is
		  scaled by a factor of "scale"/1000. This value should be
		  chosen to match a particular implementation.
	* Note: when IPA is used, two separate power models (simple and counter-based)
	  are used at different points so care should be taken to configure
	  both power models in the device tree (specifically dynamic-coefficient,
	  static-coefficient and scale) to best match the platform.
- system-coherency : Sets the coherency protocol to be used for coherent
		     accesses made from the GPU.
		     If not set then no coherency is used.
	- 0  : ACE-Lite
	- 1  : ACE
	- 31 : No coherency
- ipa-model : Sets the IPA model to be used for power management. GPU probe will fail if the
	      model is not found in the registered models list. If no model is specified here,
	      a gpu-id based model is picked if available, otherwise the default model is used.
	- mali-simple-power-model: Default model used on mali
- protected-mode-switcher : Phandle to device implemented protected mode switching functionality.
Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/smc-protected-mode-switcher.txt for one implementation.
