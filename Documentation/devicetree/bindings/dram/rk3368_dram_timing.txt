* rk3368 dram default timing is at arch/arm64/boot/dts/rk3368_dram_default_timing.dtsi

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "rockchip,ddr-timing"
- dram_spd_bin : value is defined at include/dt-bindings/clock/ddr.h
  it select ddr3 cl-trp-trcd type, default value "DDR3_DEFAULT".it must selected
  according to "Speed Bin" in ddr3 datasheet, DO NOT use smaller "Speed Bin" than
  ddr3 exactly is.

- sr_idle : configure the SR_IDLE value, defined the selfrefresh idle period,
  memories are places into self-refresh mode if bus is idle for SR_IDLE*32 DFI
  clocks (DFI clocks freq is half of dram's clocks), defaule value is "1"

- pd_idle : config the PD_IDLE value, defined the power-down idle period, memories
  are places into power-down mode if bus is idle for PD_IDLE DFI clocks.

- dram_dll_disb_freq : it's defined the DDR3 dll bypass frequency in MHz (Mega Hz),
  when ddr freq less than DRAM_DLL_DISB_FREQ, ddr3 dll will bypssed
  note: if dll was bypassed, the odt also stop working.

- phy_dll_disb_freq : defined the PHY dll bypass frequency in MHz (Mega Hz),
  when ddr freq less than DRAM_DLL_DISB_FREQ, phy dll will bypssed
  note: phy dll and phy odt are independent

- dram_odt_disb_freq : defined the DDR3 and LPDDR3 odt disable frequency in
  MHz (Mega Hz), when ddr frequency less then DRAM_ODT_DISB_FREQ, the DDR3
  and LPDDR3 ODT are disabled.

- phy_odt_disb_freq : defined the PHY odt disable frequency in MHz (Mega Hz),
  when ddr frequency less then PHY_ODT_DISB_FREQ, the PHY ODT are disabled.

- ddr3_drv : define the DDR3 driver stength in ohm, default value is DDR3_DS_40

- ddr3_odt : define the DDR3 ODT in ohm, default value is DDR3_ODT_120

- lpddr3_drv : define the lPDDR3 driver stength in ohm, default value is LP3_DS_34

- lpddr3_odt : define the LPDDR3 ODT in ohm, default value is LP3_ODT_240

- lpddr2_drv : define the LPDDR2 driver stength in ohm, default value is LP2_DS_34

- phy_clk_drv : define the phy clocks driver strength in ohm, default value is
  PHY_RON_45ohm

- phy_cmd_drv : define the phy commands driver strength in ohm, default value is
  PHY_RON_34ohm

- phy_dqs_drv : define the phy dqs and dq driver strength in ohm, default value is
  PHY_RON_34ohm

- phy_odt : define the phy odt in ohm, default value isPHY_RTT_279ohm

the driver strength and odt value are defined at include/dt-bindings/dram/rockchip,rk3368.h
