- #clock-cells : shall be set to 0.

Optional property:
- clock-output-names : From common clock binding.

Example:
	pvtm_clock: pvtm-clock {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3368-pvtm-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&cru SCLK_PVTM_PMU>;
		clock-names = "pvtm_pmu_clk";
		clock-output-names = "xin32k_pvtm";
		status = "okay";
