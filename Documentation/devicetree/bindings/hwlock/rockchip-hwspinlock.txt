Rockchip HW Spinlock Device Binding
===================================

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
	"rockchip,hwspinlock"

- reg : the register address of hwspinlock

- #hwlock-cells : hwlock users only use the hwlock id to represent a specific
	hwlock, so the number of cells should be <1> here.

Please look at the generic hwlock binding for usage information for consumers,
"Documentation/devicetree/bindings/hwlock/hwlock.txt"

Example of hwlock provider:
	hwlock: hwspinlock@ff040000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,hwspinlock";
		reg = <0 0xff040000 0 0x10000>;
		#hwlock-cells = <1>;
	};

Example of hwlock users:
	node {
		...
		hwlocks = <&hwlock 0>;
		...
	};
