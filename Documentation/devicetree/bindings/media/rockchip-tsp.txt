device-tree bindings for rockchip Transport Stream Processing Module (TSP)

TSP is designed for processing Transport Stream Packets,
including receiving TS packets, PID filtering, TS descrambling,
De-multiplexing and TS outputting.Processed data are transferred to
memory buffer which are continued to be processing by software.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following
		"rockchip,rk312x-tsp";
		"rockchip,rk3228-tsp";
		"rockchip,rk3288-tsp";
		"rockchip,rk3328-tsp";
		"rockchip,rk3368-tsp";

- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.

- interrupts: TSP interrupt specifier.

- interrupts-name: should be "irq_tsp".

- clocks: phandle to TSP sclk/hclk/aclk clocks

- clock-names: should be "clk_tsp", "hclk_tsp" and "aclk_tsp"

- pinctrl-names: use "default"

- pinctrl-0: pin config for iomux

Example:
SoC-specific DT entry:
	tsp: tsp@ff050000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3328-tsp";
		reg = <0x0 0xff050000 0x0 0x10000>;
		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 72 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "irq_tsp";
		clocks = <&cru SCLK_TSP>, <&cru ACLK_TSP>, <&cru HCLK_TSP>;
		clock-names = "clk_tsp", "aclk_tsp", "hclk_tsp";
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&tsp_d0
			     &tsp_d1
			     &tsp_d2
			     &tsp_d3
			     &tsp_d4
			     &tsp_d5
			     &tsp_d6
			     &tsp_d7
			     &tsp_sync
			     &tsp_clk
			     &tsp_fail
			     &tsp_valid>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
