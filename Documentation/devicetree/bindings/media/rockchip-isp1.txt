Rockchip SoC Image Signal Processing unit v1
----------------------------------------------

Rockchip ISP1 is the Camera interface for the Rockchip series of SoCs
which contains image processing, scaling, and compression funcitons.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following
	"rockchip,rk1808-rkisp1";
	"rockchip,rk3288-rkisp1";
	"rockchip,rk3326-rkisp1";
	"rockchip,rk3368-rkisp1";
	"rockchip,rk3399-rkisp1";
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: should contain ISP interrupt.
- clocks: phandle to the required clocks.
- clock-names: required clock name.
- iommus: required a iommu node.

port node
-------------------

The device node should contain one 'port' child node with child 'endpoint'
nodes, according to the bindings defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
media/video-interfaces.txt.

- endpoint(parallel):
	- remote-endpoint: Connecting to a sensor with a parallel video bus.
	- parallel_bus properties: Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
		media/video-interfaces.txt.
- endpoint(mipi):
	- remote-endpoint: Connecting to Rockchip MIPI-DPHY,
		which is defined in rockchip-mipi-dphy.txt.

The port node must contain at least one endpoint, either parallel or mipi.
It could have multiple endpoints, but please note the hardware don't support
two sensors work at a time, they are supposed to work asynchronously.

		clock-names = "clk_isp",
			      "aclk_isp", "aclk_isp_wrap",
			      "hclk_isp", "hclk_isp_wrap";
		power-domains = <&power RK3399_PD_ISP0>;
		iommus = <&isp0_mmu>;

		port {
			#address-cells = <1>;

			/* mipi */
			isp0_mipi_in: endpoint@0 {

				remote-endpoint = <&dphy_rx0_out>;
			};

			/* parallel */
			isp0_parallel_in: endpoint@1 {

				bus-width = <8>;
			};
		};
	};
