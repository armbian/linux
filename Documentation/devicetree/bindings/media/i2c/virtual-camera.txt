* Rockchip Virtual Camera

The virtual sensor supports multiple resolutions output,
such as 1280x720,1920x1080,3840x720,3840x2160,5120x2880.
It also can support RGB24 or raw output formats.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Must be "rockchip,virtual-camera"
- reg: I2C slave address, this value is useless.
- link-frequencies: target mipi clock frequency, half of mipi data rate.

Optional Properties:
- width: output pixel width.
- height: output pixel height.
- bus-format: output bus format, it is a media bus format code.

The device node must contain one 'port' child node for its digital output
video port, in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	&i2c0 {
		...
		...
		 vcamera@30 {
			compatible = "rockchip,virtual-camera";
			reg = <0x30>;
			width = <1920>;
			height = <1080>;
			bus-format = <MEDIA_BUS_FMT_BGGR8_1X8>;

			port {
				vcamera_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&dphy_rx_in>;
					link-frequencies = /bits/ 64 <500000000>;
				};
			};
		};
		...
	};
