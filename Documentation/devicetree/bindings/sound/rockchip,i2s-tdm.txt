* Rockchip I2S/TDM controller

Required properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following
   - "rockchip,rk3308-i2s-tdm": for rk3308
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: should contain the I2S interrupt.
- dmas: DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
- dma-names: should include "tx" and "rx".
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifer pairs, one for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: clock names.
- rockchip,bclk-fs: configure the bclk fs.
- resets: a list of phandle + reset-specifer paris, one for each entry in reset-names.
- reset-names: reset names, should include "tx-m", "rx-m".
- rockchip,cru: cru phandle.
- rockchip,mclk-calibrate: enable mclk source calibration.
- rockchip,clk-trcm: tx and rx lrck/bclk common use.
   - 0: both tx_lrck/bclk and rx_lrck/bclk are used
   - 1: only tx_lrck/bclk is used
   - 2: only rx_lrck/bclk is used
- rockchip,no-dmaengine: This is a boolean property. If present, driver will do not
  register pcm dmaengine, only just register dai. if the dai is part of multi-dais,
  the property should be present. Please refer to rockchip,multidais.txt about
  multi-dais usage.

	clock-names = "mclk_tx", "mclk_rx", "hclk";
	dmas = <&dmac1 0>, <&dmac1 1>;
	dma-names = "tx", "rx";
