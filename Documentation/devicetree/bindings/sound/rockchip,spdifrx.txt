* Rockchip SPDIF Receiver

The S/PDIF audio block is a stereo receiver that allows the
processor to receive and digital audio via an coaxial cable or
a fibre cable.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following:
   - "rockchip,rk3308-spdifrx"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: should contain the SPDIF interrupt.
- dmas: DMA specifiers for rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
- dma-names: should be "rx"
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
  in clock-names.
- clock-names: should contain following:
   - "hclk": clock for SPDIF controller
   - "mclk" : clock for SPDIF bus
- resets: a list of phandle + reset-specifer paris, one for each entry in reset-names.
- reset-names: reset names, should include "spdifrx-m".

Example for the rk3308 SPDIF-RX controller:

spdif_rx: spdif-rx@ff3b0000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk3308-spdifrx";
	reg = <0x0 0xff3b0000 0x0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 56 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&cru SCLK_SPDIF_RX>, <&cru HCLK_SPDIFRX>;
	clock-names = "mclk", "hclk";
	dmas = <&dmac1 14>;
	dma-names = "rx";
	resets = <&cru SRST_SPDIFRX_M>;
	reset-names = "spdifrx-m";
	status = "disabled";
};
