Binding for TI bq25703 Li-Ion Charger

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain one of the following:
    * "ti,bq25703"
- reg: integer, i2c address of the device.
- ti,max-charge-voltage: integer, maximum charging voltage (in uV);
- ti,charge-current: integer, maximum charging current (in uA);
- ti,minimum-sys-voltage: integer, when battery is charging and it is below
    minimum system voltage, the system will be regulated above
    minimum-sys-voltage setting (in uV);

Optional properties:

Example:

	bq25703@6b {
		compatible = "ti,bq25703";
		reg = <0x6b>;

		ti,max-charge-voltage = <4200000>;
		ti,charge-current = <1000000>;
		ti,minimum-sys-voltage = <3600000>;
	};
