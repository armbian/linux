Binding for TI bq25700 Li-Ion Charger

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain one of the following:
    * "ti,bq25700"
- reg: integer, smbus address of the device.
- ti,battery-regulation-voltage: integer, maximum charging voltage (in uV);
- ti,charge-current: integer, maximum charging current (in uA);
- ti,minimum-sys-voltage: integer, when battery is charging and it is below
    minimum system voltage, the system will be regulated above
    minimum-sys-voltage setting (in uV);

Optional properties:

Example:

bq25700 {
        compatible = "ti,bq25700";
        reg = <0x09>;

        ti,charge-current = <1000000>;
        ti,termination-current = <50000>;
        ti,minimum-sys-voltage = <3600000>;
};
