ROCKCHIP USB2.0 PHY WITH INNO IP BLOCK

Required properties (phy (parent) node):
 - compatible : should be one of the listed compatibles:
	* "rockchip,px30-usb2phy"
	* "rockchip,rk3128-usb2phy"
	* "rockchip,rk322x-usb2phy"
	* "rockchip,rk3308-usb2phy"
	* "rockchip,rk3328-usb2phy"
	* "rockchip,rk3366-usb2phy"
	* "rockchip,rk3368-usb2phy"
	* "rockchip,rk3399-usb2phy"
 - reg : the address offset of grf for usb-phy configuration.
 - #clock-cells : should be 0.
 - clock-output-names : specify the 480m output clock name.

Optional properties:
 - clocks : phandle + phy specifier pair, for the input clock of phy.
 - clock-names : input clock name of phy, must be "phyclk".
 - assigned-clocks : phandle of usb 480m clock.
 - assigned-clock-parents : parent of usb 480m clock, select between
		 usb-phy output 480m and xin24m.
		 Refer to clk/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock
		 consumer properties.
 - rockchip,u2phy-tuning: when set, tuning u2phy to improve usb2 SI.
 - vbus-supply: regulator phandle for vbus power source.

Required nodes : a sub-node is required for each port the phy provides.
		 The sub-node name is used to identify host or otg port,
		 and shall be the following entries:
	* "otg-port" : the name of otg port.
	* "host-port" : the name of host port.

Required properties (port (child) node):
 - #phy-cells : must be 0. See ./phy-bindings.txt for details.
 - interrupts : specify an interrupt for each entry in interrupt-names.
 - interrupt-names : a list which shall be the following entries:
	* "otg-id" : for the otg id interrupt.
	* "otg-bvalid" : for the otg vbus interrupt.
	* "linestate" : for the host/otg linestate interrupt.

Optional properties:
 - phy-supply : phandle to a regulator that provides power to VBUS.
		See ./phy-bindings.txt for details.
 - rockchip,bypass-uart: when set, indicates that support usb to
		bypass uart feature.
		note: this property can only be added in debug stage.
 - rockchip,utmi-avalid : when set, the usb2 phy will use avalid
		status bit to get vbus status. If not, it will use
		bvalid status bit to get vbus status by default.
 - rockchip,vbus-always-on: when set, indicates that the otg vbus
		is always powered on.
 - rockchip,low-power-mode: when set, the port will enter low power
		state when suspend.

Example:

grf: syscon@ff770000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk3366-grf", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;

...

	u2phy: usb2-phy@700 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3366-usb2phy";
		reg = <0x700 0x2c>;
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-output-names = "sclk_otgphy0_480m";

		u2phy_otg: otg-port {
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 93 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 94 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 95 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			interrupt-names = "otg-id", "otg-bvalid", "linestate";
			status = "okay";
		};

		u2phy_host: host-port {
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 96 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			interrupt-names = "linestate";
			status = "okay";
		};
	};
};

Required properties (usb2phy grf node):
 - compatible : should be one of the listed compatibles:
		"rockchip,px30-usb2phy-grf", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		"rockchip,rk3308-usb2phy-grf", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		"rockchip,rk3328-usb2phy-grf", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
 - reg : the address offset of grf for usb-phy configuration.
 - #address-cells : should be 1.
 - #size-cells : should be 1.

Required nodes : a sub-node is required for the phy provides.
		 The sub-node name is used to identify each phy,
		 and shall be the following entries:

Example:
