ROCKCHIP PCIE/USB3 COMBPHY WITH INNO IP BLOCK

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of the listed compatibles:
	       "rockchip,rk1808-combphy"
 - reg: Should be the address space for COMBPHY registers.
 - #phy-cells: Should be 1. The cell number is used to select the
	       phy mode as defined in <dt-bindings/phy/phy.h>,
	       <&combphy PHY_TYPE_USB3> for USB3 PHY
	       <&combphy PHY_TYPE_PCIE> for PCIE PHY
 - clocks: The phandle to clock provider and clock specifier pair.
 - clock-names: Must be "refclk", the reference clock of COMBPHY.
 - resets: The phandle to reset controller and reset specifier pair.
 - reset-names: The string reset names, must be:
		"otg-rst", "combphy-por",
		"combphy-apb", "combphy-pipe".
 - rockchip,combphygrf: The grf for COMBPHY configuration and state
			registers.

Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties.
Optional properties:
 - assigned-clocks: The phandle of COMBPHY reference clock.
 - assigned-clock-rates: The COMBPHY reference clock frequency,
			 the default clock frequency is 24MHz,
			 can be set to 25000000 or 50000000.

Examples:

combphy_grf: syscon@fe018000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,usb3phy-grf", "syscon";
	reg = <0x0 0xfe018000 0x0 0x8000>;
};

combphy: phy@ff380000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk1808-combphy";
	reg = <0x0 0xff380000 0x0 0x10000>;
	#phy-cells = <1>;
	clocks = <&cru SCLK_PCIEPHY_REF>;
	clock-names = "refclk";
	assigned-clocks = <&cru SCLK_PCIEPHY_REF>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <25000000>;
	resets = <&cru SRST_USB3_OTG_A>, <&cru SRST_PCIEPHY_POR>,
		 <&cru SRST_PCIEPHY_P>, <&cru SRST_PCIEPHY_PIPE>;
	reset-names = "otg-rst", "combphy-por",
		      "combphy-apb", "combphy-pipe";
	rockchip,combphygrf = <&combphy_grf>;
	status = "disabled";
};
