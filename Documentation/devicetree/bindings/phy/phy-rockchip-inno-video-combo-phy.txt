ROCKCHIP MIPI/LVDS/TTL VIDEO COMBO PHY WITH INNO IP BLOCK

Required properties:
 - compatible : must be one of:
	"rockchip,px30-video-phy",
	"rockchip,rk3128-video-phy",
	"rockchip,rk3368-video-phy";
 - reg : the address offset of register for phy and host configuration.
 - #phy-cells : must be 0. See ./phy-bindings.txt for details.
 - clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
	   clock-names property. See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
 - clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
		property. Must contain "ref", "pclk_phy", "pclk_host".
 - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
 - resets : phandle to the reset of phy apb clock.
 - reset-names : should be "rst".
 - power-domains: Must contain a reference to the PM domain, if available.

Example:

	video_phy: video-phy@ff2e0000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,px30-video-phy";
		reg = <0x0 0xff2e0000 0x0 0x10000>,
		      <0x0 0xff450000 0x0 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&pmucru SCLK_MIPIDSIPHY_REF>,
			 <&cru PCLK_MIPIDSIPHY>, <&cru PCLK_MIPI_DSI>;
		clock-names = "ref", "pclk_phy", "pclk_host";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		resets = <&cru SRST_MIPIDSIPHY_P>;
		reset-names = "rst";
		power-domains = <&power PX30_PD_VO>;
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
