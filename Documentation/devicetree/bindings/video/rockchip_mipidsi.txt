Device-Tree bindings for rockchip mipi dsi driver

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be "rockchip,rk32-dsi".
- rockchip,prop: dsi number.
- reg: physical base address of the hdmi and length of memory mapped
        region.
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.

- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
        clock-names property.
- clocks-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
               property. Must contain "pclk_hdmi" and "hdcp_clk_hdmi".
- status: the dsi host status;
	<disabled>: open the dsi host;
	<okay>:close the dsi host;

Example:

	dsihost0: mipi@ff960000{
		compatible = "rockchip,rk32-dsi";
		rockchip,prop = <0>;
		reg = <0xff960000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 19 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&clk_gates5 15>, <&clk_gates16 4> , <&pd_mipidsi>;
		clock-names = "clk_mipi_24m", "pclk_mipi_dsi", "pd_mipi_dsi";
		status = "okay";
	};

	dsihost1: mipi@ff964000{
		compatible = "rockchip,rk32-dsi";
		rockchip,prop = <1>;
		reg = <0xff964000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 20 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&clk_gates5 15>, <&clk_gates16 5>, <&pd_mipidsi>;
		clock-names = "clk_mipi_24m", "pclk_mipi_dsi", "pd_mipi_dsi";
		status = "okay"; 
	};
