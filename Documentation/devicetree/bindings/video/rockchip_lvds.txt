The Rockchip display port interface should be configured based on
the type of panel connected to it.
 
Required properties:
- compatible: value should be "rockchip,rk32-lvds".
- reg: physical base address and length of the LVDS registers set.
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu and interrupt proterties.
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
         clock-names property.
- clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
               property..

Example:

SoC specific DT entry:
	lvds: lvds@ff96c000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk32-lvds";
		reg = <0xff96c000 0x4000>;
		clocks = <&clk_gates16 7>;
		clock-names = "pclk_lvds";
        };
