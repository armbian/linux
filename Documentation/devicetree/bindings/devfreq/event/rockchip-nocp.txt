* Rockchip NoC (Network on Chip) Probe device

The Rockchip SoCs have NoC (Network on Chip) Probe for NoC bus.
NoC provides the primitive values to get the performance data, The
packets that the Network on Chip (NoC) probes detects are transported
over the network infrastructure to observer units. For example, RK3399
has multiple NoC probes to monitor traffic statistics for analyzing the
transaction flow.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following.
  - "rockchip,rk3288-nocp" - for RK3288 SoC.
  - "rockchip,rk3368-nocp" - for RK3368 SoC.
  - "rockchip,rk3399-nocp" - for RK3399 SoC.
- reg: physical base address of each NoC Probe and length of memory mapped region.

Example : NoC Probe nodes in Device Tree are listed below.

	nocp_cci_msch0: nocp-cci-msch0@ffa86000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-nocp";
		reg = <0xffa86000 0x400>;
	};
