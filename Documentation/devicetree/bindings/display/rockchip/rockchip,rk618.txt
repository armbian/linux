Rockchip RK618 display bridge bindings
======================================

VIF Module
----------

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following:
   "rockchip,rk618-vif"
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
	  clock-names property.
	  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
	       property. Must contain "vif", "vif_pre".

Required nodes:

The connections to the video ports are modeled using the OF graph
bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

Example:

&rk618 {
	VIF: vif {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk618-vif";
		clocks = <&CRU VIF0_CLK>, <&CRU VIF0_PRE_CLK>;
		clock-names = "vif", "vif_pre";
		status = "okay";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;

				vif_input_hdmi: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&hdmi_output_vif>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;

				vif_output_lvds: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&lvds_input_vif>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
};

LVDS Encoder
------------

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following:
   "rockchip,rk618-lvds"
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
	  clock-names property.
	  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
	       property. Must contain "lvds", "dither", "vif", "scaler".

Required nodes:

The connections to the video ports are modeled using the OF graph
bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

Example:

&rk618 {
	status = "okay";

	lvds {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk618-lvds";
		clocks = <&CRU LVDS_CLK>, <&CRU DITHER_CLK>,
			 <&CRU VIF0_CLK>, <&CRU SCALER_CLK>;
		clock-names = "lvds", "dither", "vif", "scaler";
		status = "okay";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				lvds_input_vop: endpoint@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vop_output_lvds>;
				};

				lvds_input_vif: endpoint@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vif_output_lvds>;
				};

				lvds_input_hdmi: endpoint@2 {
					reg = <2>;
					remote-endpoint = <&hdmi_output_lvds>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;

				lvds_output_panel: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&panel_input_lvds>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
};

RGB Encoder
------------

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following:
   "rockchip,rk618-rgb"
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
	  clock-names property.
	  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
	       property. Must contain "rgb", "dither", "vif", "scaler".

Required nodes:

The connections to the video ports are modeled using the OF graph
bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

Example:

&rk618 {
	status = "okay";

	rgb {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk618-rgb";
		clocks = <&CRU RGB_CLK>, <&CRU DITHER_CLK>,
			 <&CRU VIF0_CLK>, <&CRU SCALER_CLK>;
		clock-names = "rgb", "dither", "vif", "scaler";
		status = "okay";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				rgb_input_vop: endpoint@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vop_output_rgb>;
				};

				rgb_input_vif: endpoint@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vif_output_rgb>;
				};

				rgb_input_hdmi: endpoint@2 {
					reg = <2>;
					remote-endpoint = <&hdmi_output_rgb>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				rgb_lcdc1_out_tve: endpoint@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					remote-endpoint = <&tve_in_rgb_lcdc1>;
				};
				rgb_out_tve: endpoint@1 {
					status = "disabled";
					reg = <1>;
					remote-endpoint = <&tve_in_rgb>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
