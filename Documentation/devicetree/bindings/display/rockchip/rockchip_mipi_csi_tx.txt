Rockchip MIPI CSI HOST
================================

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of:
	"rockchip,rk1808-mipi-csi".
- reg: Represent the physical address range of the controller.
- interrupts: Represent the controller's interrupt to the CPU(s).
- clocks, clock-names: Phandles to the controller's APB clock(pclk) as
  described in [1].
- resets : phandle to the reset of MIPI CSI APB Clock.
- reset-names : should be "apb".
- rockchip,grf: this soc should set GRF regs to mux vopl/vopb.
- #address-cells: Should be <1>.
- #size-cells: Should be <0>.
- ports: contain a port node with endpoint definitions as defined in [2].
  For vopb,set the reg = <0> and set the reg = <1> for vopl.

Optional properties
- clocks, clock-names:
  phandle to the SNPS-PHY config clock, name should be "phy_cfg".
  phandle to the SNPS-PHY PLL reference clock, name should be "ref".
  phandle to the Non-SNPS PHY high speed clock, name should be "hs_clk".
  phandle to the h2p bridge clock, name should be "h2p".
- phys: phandle to Non-SNPS PHY node
- phy-names: the string "mipi_dphy" when is found in a node, along with "phys"
  attribute, provides phandle to MIPI PHY node
- rockchip,dual-channel: for dual-channel panel, if not, don't configure
- rockchip,lane-rate: manually configure lane-rate, not necessary.

Example:

For Rockchip RK1808:

	csi: csi@ffb20000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk1808-mipi-csi";
		clocks = <&cru PCLK_MIPI_CSI0>, <&mipi_dphy>;
		clock-names = "pclk", "hs_clk";
		phys = <&mipi_dphy>;
		phy-names = "mipi_dphy";
		resets = <&cru SRST_MIPICSI>;
		reset-names = "apb";
		...

		ports {
			port {
				csi_in_vop: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&vop_out_csi>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
