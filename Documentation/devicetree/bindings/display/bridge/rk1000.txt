Example
-------

	rk1000-tve@42 {
		status = "okay";
		compatible = "rockchip,rk1000-tve";
		reg = <0x42>;
		rockchip,data-width = <24>;
		rockchip,output = "rgb";
		rockchip,ctl = <&rk1000_ctl>;
		rockchip,tvemode = <0>;
		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			tve_in: port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				tve_in_lvds: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&lvds_out_tve>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
