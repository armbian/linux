RK1000 Multi-functional device

The RK1000-CORE are RK1000 control register block.
The chip is connected to an i2c bus.


Required properties:
- compatible : "rockchip,rk1000-ctl"
- reg: I2C slave address
- reset-gpios : the reset pin
- clocks : phandle and clock specifier
- clock-names : "mclk"

Example:
	rk1000-ctl@40 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk1000-ctl";
		reg = <0x40>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		clocks = <&cru SCLK_I2S_8CH_OUT>;
		clock-names = "mclk";
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&i2s_8ch_bus>;
		status = "okay";
	};
