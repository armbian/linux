* ROHM BD9571MWV Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) bindings

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "rohm,bd9571mwv".
 - reg			: I2C slave address.
 - interrupt-parent	: Phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
 - interrupt-controller	: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
 - #interrupt-cells	: The number of cells to describe an IRQ, should be 2.
			    The first cell is the IRQ number.
			    The second cell is the flags, encoded as trigger
			    masks from ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.
 - gpio-controller      : Marks the device node as a GPIO Controller.
 - #gpio-cells          : Should be two.  The first cell is the pin number and
                            the second cell is used to specify flags.
                            See ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.
 - regulators:          : List of child nodes that specify the regulator
                            initialization data. Child nodes must be named
                            after their hardware counterparts:
			     - vd09
			     - vd18
			     - vd25
			     - vd33
			     - dvfs
			    Each child node is defined using the standard
			    binding for regulators.

Example:

	pmic: pmic@30 {
		compatible = "rohm,bd9571mwv";
		reg = <0x30>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio2>;
		interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;

		regulators {
			dvfs: dvfs {
				regulator-name = "dvfs";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <750000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1030000>;
				regulator-boot-on;
				regulator-always-on;
			};
		};
	};
