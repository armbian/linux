- Clean up and move the ov5642 subdev driver to drivers/media/i2c, or
  merge support for OV5642 into drivers/media/i2c/ov5640.c, and create
  the binding docs for it.

- The Frame Interval Monitor could be exported to v4l2-core for
  general use.

- At driver load time, the device-tree node that is the original source
  (the "sensor"), is parsed to record its media bus configuration, and
  this info is required in imx-media-csi.c to setup the CSI.
  Laurent Pinchart argues that instead the CSI subdev should call its
  neighbor's g_mbus_config op (which should be propagated if necessary)
  to get this info. However Hans Verkuil is planning to remove the
  g_mbus_config op. For now this driver uses the parsed DT mbus config
  method until this issue is resolved.

- This media driver supports inheriting V4L2 controls to the
  video capture devices, from the subdevices in the capture device's
  pipeline. The controls for each capture device are updated in the
  link_notify callback when the pipeline is modified. It should be
  decided whether this feature is useful enough to make it generally
  available by exporting to v4l2-core.
