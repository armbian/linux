# Makefile for embedded code blobs for Rockchip SoCs
#
# These code blobs are emedded into vmlinux and copied into SRAM
# at times when SDRAM is not available.  Each blob is self contained.
#
# Some blobs may be linked to expect to run at a very specific address.
# A good example is resume code blobs that always expect to run in a
# very specific bit of SRAM that keeps power during sleep.  This code
# is also running with the cache off so it can predict the address it
# will be at.
#
# Other blobs may be linked with -fpic (by adding CFLAGS_file.o := -fpic).
# These can be located anywhere.  I believe gcc will support this by
# assuming that the .text and .data sections are relative to each other.
#
# That brings up the point that all blobs here:
# - Are generally very small
# - Generally have code and data jammed together in one blob.
# - Generally have "parameters" at the beginning that are filled in by
#   the kernel.
